This course aims to introduce the basic concepts and features of programming languages and different programming paradigms

# PE1
In this programming exam, I used Haskell to construct the building blocks of
a recipe calculator system, which keeps track of recipes, ingredients and generates shopping
lists for convenient management

# PE4
In this programming exam, I used object-oriented paradigm (polymorphism,
encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance) to construct an automatic-differentiation system (auto-grad) which takes expression trees of polynomials (parsed implicitly thanks to
operator overloading) and produces another expression tree representing the result of few
complex operations like the gradient with respect to a variable or the evaluation under some
constrains. To this end, I implemented given C++ classes inherited from an
abstract class and overload it’s four pure methods.

# PE5

This homework is designed to measure the knowledge about the most common object-oriented concepts such as
Inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. My job was to create a tournament where 4 different types of bands
compete. The band types are:
• RockBand
• JazzBand
• MetalBand
• KPopBand

# PE6

After a country-wide decision, it is decided that city councils should be merged in pairs for all cities in
the country of Parklandia. Two competing cities, Pawnee and Eagleton are selected as a pair by the
Parklandia government, and the city councils of the two cities now need to hold a new election to create
a new, merged council.

In this exam, I implemented different predicates with varying difficulties. All predicates will be queried with different arguments given as variables, but not all arguments will be queried
for all predicates. In this assignment I used Prolog.
